# 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Current Problem
**Senders cannot see their own sent messages** because:
1. The encryption key was not properly saved OR
2. The encryption key expired and was deleted OR  
3. The database schema prevents key sharing

## ⚡ Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Run Diagnostic (2 minutes)
```powershell
python diagnose_email.py
```
Enter your email when prompted. This will show you EXACTLY what's wrong.

### Step 2: Run Migration (REQUIRED - 1 minute)
```powershell
python migrate_keys_table.py
```
Type "yes" when prompted. This fixes the database schema.

### Step 3: Restart Application
```powershell
# Stop the current app (Ctrl+C in the terminal running it)
# Then start it again:
python qumail_client/app.py
```

### Step 4: Test with NEW Email
1. Go to http://localhost:6969/compose
2. Send a test email to yourself or another user
3. Check if you can view and decrypt it

## 📊 Expected Results After Fix

### What SHOULD happen:
✅ Sender can decrypt their own sent emails  
✅ Recipient can decrypt received emails  
✅ Both users have access to the same encryption key  
✅ Debug page shows encryption test passes  

### Logs should show:
```
Generated quantum key abc-123 for user sender@email.com
Shared decryption key abc-123 with recipient recipient@email.com
```

## 🔍 Understanding the Issue

### OLD Emails (before migration):
- ❌ Keys were not shared
- ❌ Keys may have expired
- ❌ Database schema prevented sharing
- 💡 **Solution**: Re-send or share keys retroactively

### NEW Emails (after migration):
- ✅ Keys are automatically shared
- ✅ Both sender and recipient can decrypt
- ✅ Database schema supports sharing

## 🛠️ Advanced: Fix Old Emails

If you need to access old emails, run this script AFTER migration:

```python
# fix_old_emails.py
from qumail_client.embedded_km.neon_key_manager import NeonKeyManager
from config.settings import load_config
import psycopg2

config = load_config()
km = NeonKeyManager(config)

# Get your email
your_email = "orchidbgmievent@gmail.com"  # Change this

# Get all your sent emails
sent_emails = km.get_sent_emails(your_email)

print(f"Found {len(sent_emails)} sent emails")

for email in sent_emails:
    key_id = email.get('encryption_key_id')
    recipient = email.get('recipient')
    
    if key_id and recipient:
        try:
            # Share key with recipient
            km.share_key_with_recipient(key_id, your_email, recipient)
            print(f"✓ Shared key for email to {recipient}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"✗ Failed for {recipient}: {e}")
```

Save this as `fix_old_emails.py` and run:
```powershell
python fix_old_emails.py
```

## 📞 Still Not Working?

1. **Check the logs**: `logs/qumail.log`
2. **Run diagnostic**: `python diagnose_email.py`
3. **Visit debug page**: http://localhost:6969/debug/keys
4. **Check this log entry**: Look for "✗ Decryption key XXX not found"

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] Ran `diagnose_email.py` - understood the problem
- [ ] Ran `migrate_keys_table.py` - database updated
- [ ] Restarted application
- [ ] Sent NEW test email
- [ ] Can view and decrypt the new email
- [ ] Both sender and recipient can decrypt
- [ ] Debug page shows encryption test passes

**Remember**: The migration is ESSENTIAL. Without it, key sharing won't work!
